Reticulate makes it easy to collaborate and talk between the two languages. I think of it as a translator on my fingertips.\nMy teammate and I participated in Microsoft hackathon where we accessed data from APIs using Python, pulled the output in R using Reticulate and created visualizations to derive business insights using Ggplot2… Check out how"

Sometimes it can tell a powerful story and sometimes it can just add some flair to an otherwise low-key story.\nThis blog goes through examples and code to show how easy it is to use gganimate and plotly packages to animate your data visualizations and make them interactive….

    "text": "Aboubacar Hema is a Research Analyst in the Development Strategies and Governance Unit. He is a data scientist, statistician, and software developer. Prior to joining IFPRI, Aboubacar worked as a data analyst with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), where he successfully implemented and analyzed the MHPSS surveys (round 1-3) as well as the endline surveys for Senegal, Guinea, Nigeria, and Gambia. He also worked as a statistician with the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research (ISRA-BAME), as well as with the Consortium for Economic and Social Research (CRES), where he was involved in the design, implementation, and analysis of various household surveys, and as an R developer (sdmApp package) with the French Agricultural Research Center for International Development (CIRAD).\nAboubacar earned a MicroMaster in Statistics and Data Science at MIT, where he learned the foundations of data science, statistics, and machine learning, using big data and probabilistic modelling to extract meaningful information for decision-making. He graduated from the National School of Statistics and Economic Analysis in Dakar and has a license 3 in Computer Science from the University of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso."
